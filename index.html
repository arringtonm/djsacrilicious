          <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
          <p>DJ Sacrilicious is a Portland, Oregon based DJ and producer who has been facilitating rump-shaking since 2000. Since then he has become one of the hardest working and highest regarded DJs in the city of Portland with a rigorous schedule of performances, mixtape releases, and custom production work.</p>
          <p>His background as a diverse fan of music and classically trained performer lends to an artistic presentation and musically creative approach, but most of this is left “under the hood”—he simultaneously plays to both the tastemakers and the casual music fans by introducing even the most heavily rotated pop music in a fresh and danceable form. Most importantly, he understands one of the open secrets in getting the party started: “always focus on the girls.”</p>
          ﻿<p>Equally comfortable in an intimate lounge, a beachfront wedding, ballroom, large nightclub, dive bar, corporate event or house party, DJ Sacrilicious is a true performer who adeptly reads the vibe of the room and thrives off of the crowds’ energy, whether it be a sweaty dance party or a subdued head bobbing environment. After building his foundation in party rocking in the era of analog (with the scattered vinyl around his home to prove it), he has been an eager adopter of digital technologies and uses every tool at his disposal to keep the mood just right. He is comfortable on the microphone, rocks exclusive custom edits and remixes, and also has a stable of signature live blends of crowd favorites mastered over time.</p>

          <p>"Michael was fabulous to work with. We had a wide range of ages at our reception and he kept EVERYONE out on the dance floor. He played the best music. He knew when to change the pace. He was great at announcing the different portions of our reception and our ceremony and cocktail music was fabulous. We couldn't have had a better DJ. Thanks Michael" -Beth</p>

          <p>"We couldn't have asked for a better DJ for our wedding! He was professional, took down a ton of notes and created a detailed timeline for everything we wanted / entrances / announcements. He was also really warm and just an awesome person to have at our party. My husband is chilean and DJ Sacrilicious got EVERYONE dancing.. from my family to his older family to all of our friends. He knew exactly how to read the room and play a fun party until the very end! All of our guests commented (even two of our friends who are DJs) that he did an amazing job and his music taste was spot-on. I wish we could have another huge party and have him again." -Micaela</p>

        <p>"What kind of music do you spin?"</p>
        <p>The most common first question a DJ gets doesn't have a simple answer. I've found the best approach is to focus on the people in front of me; the best DJing is one that pushes and pulls the energy in the room. My sets are diverse and depend on where I'm playing and who I'm playing for. Check out a few live and produced mixes below! <br><br>
