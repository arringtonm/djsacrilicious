      <p>DJ Sacrilicious is a Portland, Oregon based DJ and producer who has been inciting dance floor riots since 2000. Since then he has become one of the hardest working and highest regarded DJs in the city of Portland with a rigorous schedule of performances, mixtape releases, and custom production work.</p>

      <p>His background as diverse fan of music and classically trained performer lends to an artistic presentation and musically creative approach, but most of this is left “under the hood”—he simultaneously plays to both the tastemakers and the casual music fans by introducing even the most heavily rotated pop music in a fresh and danceable form. Most importantly, he understands one of the open secrets in getting the party started: “always focus on the girls.”</p>

      ﻿<p>Equally comfortable in an intimate lounge, a beachfront wedding, ballroom, large nightclub, dive bar, corporate event or house party, DJ Sacrilicious is a true performer who adeptly reads the vibe of the room and thrives off of the crowds’ energy, whether it be a sweaty dance party or a subdued head bobbing environment. After building his foundation in party rocking in the era of analog (with the scattered vinyl around his home to prove it), he has been an eager adopter of digital technologies and uses every tool at his disposal to keep the mood just right. He is comfortable on the microphone, rocks exclusive custom edits and remixes, and also has a stable of signature live blends of crowd favorites mastered over time.</p>

      <p>DJ Sacrilicious truly brings the party wherever he goes. His adaptable style of sexy, fun, and energetic dance music—infused with requisite classics—pulls in partygoers and draws an ever expanding base of dedicated dancers and music fans.  In addition to his preferred open format (fancy speak for mixing great music amongst many genres), he can also cater specifically to the needs of the event and prepare sets as well as adapt on the fly.</p>
