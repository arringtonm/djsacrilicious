"Michael was fabulous to work with. We had a wide range of ages at our reception and he kept EVERYONE out on the dance floor. He played the best music. He knew when to change the pace. He was great at announcing the different portions of our reception and our ceremony and cocktail music was fabulous. We couldn't have had a better DJ. Thanks, Michael."

"We couldn't have asked for a better DJ for our wedding! He was professional, took down a ton of notes and created a detailed timeline for everything we wanted/entrances/announcements. He was also really warm and just an awesome person to have at our party. My husband is chilean and DJ Sacrilicious got EVERYONE dancing.. from my family to his older family to all of our friends. He knew exactly how to read the room and play a fun party until the very end! All of our guests commented (even two of our friends who are DJs) that he did an amazing job and his music taste was spot-on. I wish we could have another huge party and have him again."
